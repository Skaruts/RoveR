# RoveR

### <i> Your battery is low and it’s getting dark </i>

RoveR is a roguelike about a planetary rover created using [R](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R_(programming_language)) and the package [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). 

This is my entry in the [/r/roguelikedev](https://www.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/) 2019 summer tutorial. I am not a developer, and this is entirely a hobby project. I’m not aware of any games made with R (perhaps for a good reason)! Let's see if it's possible. You can play my most recent deployment [here](https://foxfields.shinyapps.io/rover/). Be patient, the demo requires about 30 seconds to load when hosted. It's almost instant locally, I swear!

Controls: WASD keys to move

<i> Not working?</i> The RoveR app is being hosted for free. If the application is active for more than 25 hours, it will be unavaliable to users. 

### Mission Progress: 

#### Week 2: "Apollo Lunar Rover"

This week's mission brings tile collision, non-player entities and a temporary 'dungeon' for exploring. Performance is great when run locally, but relatively slow when the shiny app is hosted.

#### Week 1: "Lunokhod 1"

Huzzah! By using R along with the package Shiny, I was able to create the basic environment and move the player rover "@" around the screen.
