# RoveR

#### <i> Your battery is low and it’s getting dark </i>

RoveR is a roguelike about a planetary rover created using R and the package Shiny. 

This is my entry in the /r/roguelikedev 2019 summer tutorial. I am not a developer, and this is entirely a hobby project. I’m not aware of any games made with R (perhaps for a good reason)! Let's see if it is possible.
